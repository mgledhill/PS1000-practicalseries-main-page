This is the website source code for the Practical Series of Publications website:
**Main Page (landing page)**.

## Contents

This website is a series of publications that explain how to use a website development template, how to apply version control with Git, GitHub and the Brackets text editor and how to understand various control system engineer platforms.

This repository contains the landing page of the website and its associated files.

Each additional publication has its own repository. Currently there are the following publications and repositories:

1.	PS1000-practicalseries-main-page (this repository)
2.	PS1001-website-development-template
3.	PS1002-brackets-git-and-github-vcs

## Installation

There are no installation requirements for the website itself (it’s just a website—*obviously you need a browser, but you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t have that*).

## Permissions in lieu of a licence

### THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT OPEN SOURCE

Everything in this repository belongs to me and not you.

I give you permission to reuse or adapt any of the website source code, specifically the JavaScript, CSS and HTML elements for your own website projects. 

If you do wish to use the website source code, there is another [Practical Series Publication]( http://practicalseries.com/1001-webdevelopment/index.html) that better explains exactly how to do this.

**I do NOT** give permission for you to reuse or republish any of the content of this website or documents within this repository (including text, images, and PDFs).

**I do NOT** give permission for you to reuse the fonts that are embedded within the CSS files; these are purchased third party fonts—you may buy your own copy [here](http://practicaltypography.com/equity.html).

## Development branch abbreviations

All development branches begin with a lower case 'd', the bulk of the development work takes place within the website itself (the directory starting 5-2361) and development branches associated with this area have the simplest designation (d-). Other workflows have longer designations, these being in the form ```dXX-``` where ```XX``` are two uppercase letters that specify the appropriate area.

The following table contains the development branch abbreviations and associated workflow areas (folders):

| Development<br>branch abbreviation  | Associated repository folder
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------
| d-                 | 5-2361-website-source
| dAD-               | 0-0201-repostiory-information (admin)
